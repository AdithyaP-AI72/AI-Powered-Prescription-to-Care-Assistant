System Prerequisites
Before you begin, you need to have the following installed on your system. These are dependencies that exist outside the Python virtual environment.

Python (3.9+): Download Python

Node.js (18.x or newer): Download Node.js

Tesseract-OCR: This is required for the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to work.

Windows: Download and run the installer from Tesseract at UB Mannheim. Important: During installation, make sure to check the box to add Tesseract to your system's PATH.

macOS (using Homebrew): brew install tesseract

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

üö® Ensure that in main.py the line -- pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r" The path where tesseract is downloaded ".

üöÄ Setup Instructions
1. API Keys & Security Notice
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: For the purpose of this hackathon, the necessary API keys have been pre-configured in the .env (backend) and .env.local (frontend) files.

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to your backend directory from the terminal.

cd path/to/your/backend

a. Create a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv

b. Activate the Virtual Environment:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

c. Install Python Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

d. Google Calendar Authentication:

Run the calendar_auth.py script once to authorize access to your Google Calendar. This will create a token.json file.

python calendar_auth.py

e. Run the Backend Server:

uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will now be running at http://localhost:8000.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to your frontend directory.

cd path/to/your/frontend

a. Install Node.js Dependencies:

npm install

b. Run the Frontend Development Server:

npm run dev

The frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000. The API keys are already configured in the .env.local file and should work out of the box.
